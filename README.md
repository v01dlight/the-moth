Rolls dice! Supports several formats, both for *Invisible Sun* and *Suns Apart*/*Age of Iron*:
- Default: rolls a single mundane die (d10).  
- `+[num]`: Roll that many Invisible Sun magic dice.  
- `[count]d[sides]`: Roll arbitrary dice (only one die size at a time).  
- `+/-[bonus]`: Apply a bonus or penalty.  

**Examples:**  
```

/roll                  # rolls 1 mundane die (d10)
/roll dice: +3         # rolls a mundane die and 3 magic dice
/roll dice: 2d6 +3     # rolls 2 six-sided dice plus 3
/roll dice: 4d8 -1     # rolls 4 eight-sided dice minus 1

```

#### `/save [advantage] [stat]`
Make a saving throw.  
- **advantage**: Positive for advantage, negative for disadvantage.  
- **stat**: The value of the stat you are checking against.  

**Examples:**  
```

/save                              # rolls a single d20
/save advantage: 1 stat: 12        # rolls with advantage against stat 12
/save advantage: -2 stat: 15       # rolls with double disadvantage against stat 15

```

## Installation
### Running Locally
You can either run this directly or through Docker. Either way, you'll
also need to create a bot token, which you can find instructions on
[here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/).

To run directly, you'll need python3 and pip3 installed. Then you can run the following:

``` shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
MOTH_BOT_TOKEN=$your_bot_token python3 theMoth.py
```

If you're interested in using docker, you can build and run using the following commands:

``` shell
docker build -t the-moth .
docker run -e MOTH_BOT_TOKEN=$your_bot_token the-moth
```

### Running on a Remote Server
For the "official" instance of the bot, I pay for a cloud server and I run it off that with [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) to ensure that the bot process stays alive with no downtime. Since I was constantly forgetting how to update the production instance of the bot after making code changes, I created a setup script which automates the process of updating some tooling and replacing the running bot process with a fresh one. So for me, the way I would run this is:

``` shell
ssh root@$my_server_ip
git clone https://github.com/v01dlight/the-moth.git
cd the-moth
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh "$my_bot_token"
```
